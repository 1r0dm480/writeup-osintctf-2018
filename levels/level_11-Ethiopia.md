```
While pen-testing an organization in Germany, our pen-tester figured out the redis build id, i.e. ef08edc3eb2339c3. He was trying to figure out the run id of the server to compromise it further. However, since the connectivity dropped, IP changed. Can you figure out the 'run_id' of this server.```
